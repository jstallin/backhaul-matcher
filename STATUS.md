## What Was Just Completed
- Created `staging` branch in GitHub
- Created staging Vercel project tracking `staging` branch
- Configured staging Supabase project (`haul-monitor-staging`, ID: `vdrkpitooqgmmlfrbphi`)
- Updated `.github/workflows/test.yml` to support staging branch + dynamic Playwright URLs
- Added GitHub Actions secrets for staging Supabase credentials
- Fixed `auth.setup.js` to gracefully skip when TEST_EMAIL/TEST_PASSWORD not set
- Added Vitest unit tests for `calculateDistance` and `calculateNetRevenue` (32 tests)
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with staging details, UX version clarification, infrastructure status
- Created `docs/specs/dedicated-fleet-planning.md`
- Established STATUS.md workflow as Claude.ai ↔ Claude Code sync bridge
- Staging custom domain (`staging.haulmonitor.cloud`) created

---

## In Progress / Next Up
- Initial coding of Work Week Planning done and deployed to feature/work-week-planning
- Corporate card arriving soon — upgrade Supabase + Vercel to paid tiers before pilots go live
- Pilots starting this week or next (1-2 customers)

---

## Key Decisions Made This Session
- CLAUDE.md is the persistent technical context bridge between Claude.ai and Claude Code
- STATUS.md is the living current-state doc, updated each session and shared across both
- Staging workflow: feature branch → PR to staging → CI → merge to staging → PR to main → production
- Playwright authenticated tests deferred until proper auth flow is built out (item #3 follow-up)
- Supabase legacy anon/service_role keys used in staging (consistent with production)
- Both v1 and v2 UX must be supported — neither is deprecated

---

## Open Questions / Blockers
- Corporate card for Supabase Pro + Vercel Pro upgrades
- Authenticated Playwright tests need proper auth flow implementation

---

## Pilots
- 1-2 pilot customers starting this week or next
- First pilot confirmed: has valid Truckstop integration ID
- Production stability is top priority during pilot period
